Dimensions :

The map is infinite, like Rogue Game, but will respect this :

Jake's Worshop at x: -4, y: 0, represented by J on the map;
Spawn Point at x: 0, y: 0, represented by O on the map
Stella at x: -12, y: 12, represented by S;
Player represented by the first letter of the entered Name;

Controls

The player will use arrows to move in the map. When the player presses escape then, he needs to write :actiondesired to do the action, like in Vim.

Display

The game will print only one time the map, and can render the map 16*16. When the player oves in the map, it updates the displayed map without reprinting it, like in the Game Rogue released in 1984.
Under the map, the player will see the following informations :
>>> Enter Action by pressing : then the action
>>> Type help for a full actions list.
